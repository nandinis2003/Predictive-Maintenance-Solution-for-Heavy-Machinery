# Predictive Maintenance Solution for Heavy Machinery

• Engineered a cost-effective predictive solution with a team of 6 members by designing a model that forecasts machinery failures
at the logs recording level, enabling operators to take measures.

• Leveraged time series analysis and LSTM techniques to accurately forecast failures within a 17.33-hour window (+/- 8.66 hours).

• Optimized maintenance scheduling by empowering log recorders to detect potential failures before scheduled maintenance,
facilitating timely analysis and preventive actions.

• Delivered a scalable and practical solution that is easily deployable, ensuring accessibility and practicality for daily operations in
mining environments.

• Tech Stack - Python, LSTMs, Time Series Analysis, MS-Excel

Since it was a classified project, I don't have access to the original data and codebase, but I am attaching the solution that was the heart of the project.
